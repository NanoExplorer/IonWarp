### Ionic Symphonic Protonic Electronics presents:
# ION WARP

Ion Engines are the most efficient engines available. However, they are notoriously slow. The ion-powered Dawn spacecraft launched in 2007 and arrived in 2015. Ionic Symphonic Protonic Electronics' stock prices fell dramatically when investors heard about this. Nobody deserves to wait eight long years for their ion-powered probe to reach its destination! That's why we invented Ion Warp.

IonWarp is a Kerbal Space Program mod that lets you use ion engines in on-rails time warp. This lets you execute realistic maneuvers such as those seen in the DAWN mission to Ceres without having to wait the whole duration of such a mission! 

It requires Module Manager to work properly.

There are two configuration file options, one that adds warpability to all engines, one that only allows warping on low thrust engines. Both configurations are available in the "Releases" section above.

To use, right click on the engine(s) you wish to use, and set "Activate engines while warping." Then engage time warp! The engine will automatically start during time warp, although its animation will not be visible. You can use the throttle selector in the right-click menu to throttle the engine.

When the warpable engine is armed, the button will indicate that pressing it will deactivate the engines.

Future plans are very unlikely to be implemented (I'm being honest): 
 * Integrate with the Trajectories mod (or similar) to provide you with a look at where your craft will end up
 * Add engine animations to indicate when the engines are running.
 * Add a rudimentary autopilot so that you won't have to constantly stop warping and readjust your craft.
 * Re-balance ion engines to have about one one-millionth the thrust they currently have so that using this mod actually makes sense.
