IonWarp is a Kerbal Space Program mod that lets you use ion engines in on-rails time warp.

This lets you execute realistic maneuvers such as those seen in the DAWN mission to Ceres without having to wait literally years for the probe and ion engines to arrive at their destination.

It requires Module Manager to work properly.

There are two configuration file options, one that adds warpability to all engines, one that only allows warping on low thrust engines.

To use, right click on the engine(s) you wish to use, and set "Activate engines while warping."
When the warpableengine is running, the button will indicate that pressing it will deactivate the engines.

Future plans are very unlikely to be implemented (I'm being honest): 
 * Integrate with the Trajectories mod (or similar) to provide you with a look 
    at where your craft will end up
 * Add a rudimentary autopilot so that you won't have to constantly stop 
    warping and readjust your craft
 * Re-balance stock and near-future ion engines to have about one one-millionth 
    the thrust they currently have so that using this mod actually makes sense
